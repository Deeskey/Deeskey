          <h1> Whats up! My name is Deven, and I’m the proud owner and operator of Deeskey Customs, a local car detailing service based in Orem.</h1>
    
          <p>As a lifelong car enthusiast, my passion for cars started when I was a kid, and it’s only grown from there. What started as a hobby has turned into a full-time business where I can combine my love for cars with the joy of delivering a top-quality service to my community.</p> 
    
    <p>As a one-man operation, I take pride in every detail of my work. From washing and waxing to interior detailing, I treat each vehicle as if it were my own, ensuring that every client receives the best care possible. My goal is simple: to make sure your car looks and feels brand new, while providing a personal touch that larger companies just can’t match.</p>
    

     <p> I grew up in Orem and have lived all around Utah County my whole life. My love for cars started at a young age, when I first began playing with Hot Wheels. This passion for cars evolved as I got older, moving from toy cars to video games. My personal favorite was Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix. While many people gravitate toward Need for Speed, I preferred the Midnight Club series. The street racing vibe, coupled with 2000s-style hip-hop music, really resonated with me as a kid. The nostalgia from this game takes me right back to my childhood.</p>
         
         <p>When I first played the game, I chose the 1964 Chevrolet Impala as my starter car. From that point on, and with a bit of influence from my dad, who was from Southern Los Angeles, I developed a love for classic muscle cars and lowriders. The flashy chrome, big rims, and bold paint were the signature style of the early 2000s, and I was heavily influenced by The Fast and the Furious movies, as well as shows like Pimp My Ride and West Coast Customs.</p>
         
         <p>As my interest in cars grew, so did my fascination with customization. I was drawn to performance upgrades, wheels and tires, paint and graphics, and even air ride suspension and hydraulics. As a kid, I didn’t have a car to work on, but I found ways to express my creativity through my bikes and scooters. I would swap parts from different bikes to build the coolest one, often choosing the best "upgrades" I could find. At one point, I even made a lowrider scooter by putting skateboard wheels on it.</p>
     
          <p>Then, in junior high, I got <a href="myfirstcar.html">my first car</a>. That was just the beginning of my journey into the world of cars and customization!</p>
          
          <p>Throughout the years, I’ve gained my skills by doing the jobs I needed. My passion for cars started early, and I’ve never stopped learning and improving.</p>

          <p>My first car was a 1980 Cadillac Coupe DeVille. I remember charging the battery and replacing the power steering pump—this was my very first time working on a car. After selling that Cadillac, I used the money to buy a 1987 Chevy Camaro. With the help of YouTube, I taught myself how to swap the engine and transmission. From there, I bought a 1994 Chevy Caprice, which I still own, and I continue to add customizations to it.</p>

<p>In high school, I missed having a Cadillac, so I bought a 1983 Eldorado. I threw on flashy 20” rims, installed a Cherry Bomb muffler and dual exhaust pipes, but eventually, I regretted having a front-wheel-drive car. So, I got a 1979 Coupe DeVille. I added 20” 100-spoke Dayton rims, 2 12” Kenwood subs, and tinted the windows. I even welded chrome knuckle dusters to the hood as a custom ornament.</p>

          <p>At just 18 years old, I had the '83 Eldorado, '87 Camaro, '79 Coupe DeVille, and the '94 Caprice all at once! But at 19, with a baby on the way, I sold the Camaro, Eldorado, and Coupe DeVille to use the money for a place for me, my future wife, and our child.</p>

<p>Years later, my amazing wife, knowing how much I loved Cadillacs, got me a 1972 Cadillac Coupe DeVille with a huge 500 cubic-inch motor. While it was an incredible gift, I didn’t have the skills at the time to fix the rust eating away at the body. I ended up selling it and used the money to buy a 1994 Buick Roadmaster. It had the same drivetrain as my Caprice, but with more Cadillac-like styling—best of both worlds. I added 2 12” Rockville subs, 2 Rockville amps, 20” rims, and lowered the car for a more aggressive stance.</p>

          <p>After a few years, my wife and I bought a 2016 Chevy Impala as our family car. In 2019, when we were buying our first home, I sold the Roadmaster to put the money toward our down payment.</p>

<p>In 2022, I picked up a 2004 Chevy Silverado. I tinted the windows, installed a rear roll pan, added dual exhaust outlets, slapped on 24” KMC wheels, and lowered it for a more custom look. Throughout the years, I also picked up various little project cars, bought, fixed, and flipped them as side projects.</p>

<p>Throughout this journey, I’ve worked on many of my friends' cars too—installing sound systems, radios, tinting windows,lowering kits, detailing, performing maintenance, performance mods, and tackling major mechanical repairs. I also attended MATC and the UVU automotive program for auto mechanics, furthering my knowledge and expertise.</p>

<p>Now, with years of experience and continuous learning under my belt, I’m proud to launch Deeskey Customs and Detailing. Running this business has been a long-time dream, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me!</p>
