<p> Whats up! My name is Deven, and I’m the proud owner and operator of Deeskey Customs, a local car detailing service based in Orem.
    
    <br>As a lifelong car enthusiast, my passion for cars started when I was a kid, and it’s only grown from there. What started as a hobby has turned into a full-time business where I can combine my love for cars with the joy of delivering a top-quality service to my community. 
    
    <br>As a one-man operation, I take pride in every detail of my work. From washing and waxing to interior detailing, I treat each vehicle as if it were my own, ensuring that every client receives the best care possible. My goal is simple: to make sure your car looks and feels brand new, while providing a personal touch that larger companies just can’t match. 
    
    <br>Thank you for considering Deeskey Customs for your detailing needs! I can’t wait to help your car shine. </p>


     
     
     
     
     
     <p> I grew up in Orem and have lived all around Utah County my whole life. My love for cars started at a young age, when I first began playing with Hot Wheels. This passion for cars evolved as I got older, moving from toy cars to video games. My personal favorite was Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix. While many people gravitate toward Need for Speed, I preferred the Midnight Club series. The street racing vibe, coupled with 2000s-style hip-hop music, really resonated with me as a kid. The nostalgia from this game takes me right back to my childhood.</p>
         
         <p>When I first played the game, I chose the 1964 Chevrolet Impala as my starter car. From that point on, and with a bit of influence from my dad, who was from Southern Los Angeles, I developed a love for classic muscle cars and lowriders. The flashy chrome, big rims, and bold paint were the signature style of the early 2000s, and I was heavily influenced by The Fast and the Furious movies, as well as shows like Pimp My Ride and West Coast Customs.</p>
         
         <p>As my interest in cars grew, so did my fascination with customization. I was drawn to performance upgrades, wheels and tires, paint and graphics, and even air ride suspension and hydraulics. As a kid, I didn’t have a car to work on, but I found ways to express my creativity through my bikes and scooters. I would swap parts from different bikes to build the coolest one, often choosing the best "upgrades" I could find. At one point, I even made a lowrider scooter by putting skateboard wheels on it.</p>
     
         <p>Then, in junior high, I got my first car. That was just the beginning of my journey into the world of cars and customization.</p>
